# CiviCRM Autofill and Social Media Analysis Tools

### What is in this repo?
A set of scripts that have been developed to augment and complement our CiviCRM system, so that we can automate tasks, and monitor our contacts' activities with the aim of better understanding New AutoMotive's impact.

WARNING: Many of these scripts are highly bespoked to NewAutoMotive's version of CiviCRM, and will not run out of the box on other systems. 

### What do the tools in this toolkit do?
At present, there are scripts to undertake the following tasks:
- Automatically generate information about a contact's Parliamentary constituency based on their postcode. 
- Automatically create BigQuery copies of CiviCRM's relational databases, for easy data analysis and manipulation without risk of interfering with Civi's operation. 
- Automatically obtain MP's twitter handles from ParallelParliament, and - in future - other information too. 
- Monitor the CiviCRM server's storage capacity and report it to the team via Slack. 

### What good is this to me, if I'm not a New AutoMotive member of staff?
At present, not much. But if you'd like to find out more about the project, contact us on data@newautomotive.org.
